          Iâ€™m  <strong className="blue">Thanh Tuyen Nguyen</strong>  (also known as Gemma Nguyen) from Vietnam, currently living in Newcastle, NSW, Australia. I am a software developer with a passion for creating innovative solutions that leave a positive impact.
            <br />
            I recently completed my <strong className="blue">Master of Information Technology</strong> Master of Information Technology at the <strong className="blue">University of Newcastle</strong> , where I was honored to be among the <strong className="blue">top 3 students</strong> achieving <strong className="blue">Distinction</strong> in the 2024 MIT program. 
            <br />
